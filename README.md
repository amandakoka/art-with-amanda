# Art with Amanda 

Art with Amanda is a full-stack e-commerce website that I developed as my final milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Development with Code Institute. As an artist, I built this platform using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase and sell my original artworks and prints. With Stripe integration for secure payments, the website provides a user-friendly interface where visitors can explore a diverse collection of my artwork, view detailed descriptions, and make purchases seamlessly. This project not only highlights my artistic endeavors but also demonstrates my proficiency in web development, combining my passion for art with modern technologies to create an engaging online gallery experience.

### Incorporating Feedback

### Continuous Improvement

User feedback remains an important part of Art with Amanda's ongoing development and growth strategy. I will continue to actively seek suggestions and feedback from the audience throughout the development process, periodically asking for input on my Instagram and from friends and family.

## Database schema 

## Wireframes
In the initial stages of designing Art with Amanda, I created rough sketches to visualize the layout and structure of the website. These sketches served as a blueprint for the final wireframes and helped shape the overall user experience. Below are the images of these sketches:

- [Photo 4](documentation/Wireframes1/IMG_3142_2.jpg)

### Final Wireframes 

After refining my initial sketches, I created detailed wireframes using Figma. These wireframes provide a more precise and polished representation of the website's layout and functionality. Below are the finalised wireframes:

## Colour Schemes

In developing the Art with Amanda website, I prioritized a modern and simplistic design to ensure that my artwork remains the focal point. Based on user feedback, I selected a color palette consisting of different shades of white and black. This neutral color scheme helps to create a clean, elegant, and professional look that doesn't distract from the art photos.

![Color Palette](documentation/colourpalette.png)

The following is an overview of how the color scheme is applied across different sections of the website:

- **Backgrounds**: The primary background color is white, providing a bright and clean canvas for the artwork.
- **Text**: The main text color is black, and white on dark backgrounds, ensuring high readability and contrast.
- **Borders and Dividers**: A light grey is used for subtle borders and dividers, adding structure to the layout without drawing attention away from the artwork.
- **Buttons and Links**: Buttons and interactive elements are styled in a black shade to stand out and be easily identifiable.

### User Feedback Integration

The decision to use a simple and neutral color scheme was directly influenced by user feedback. Through preliminary discussions and Instagram polls, users expressed a preference for a minimalist design that highlights the artwork rather than the website itself. By adopting this feedback, the final color scheme enhances the user experience and ensures that the artwork remains the central focus of the site.

By maintaining a consistent and simplistic color scheme, the website provides a cohesive and enjoyable user experience that directs attention to the artwork while ensuring readability and ease of navigation.

## Typography

The typography for the Art with Amanda website is inspired by my logo, which features the Arapey font. To complement Arapey, I researched fonts that pair well with it and discovered Raleway. This combination was recommended by a resource on the best free Google Fonts, which you can find [here](https://daveyandkrista.com/best-free-google-fonts/#:~:text=Arapey%20would%20look%20great%20in,serif%20like%20Questrial%20or%20Raleway.).

### Font Choices

- **Arapey**: This elegant serif font is used for the headings. Its classic and sophisticated style adds a touch of refinement to the website, making it ideal for drawing attention to key areas like titles and section headers.
- **Raleway**: This clean and modern sans-serif font is used for body text. Ralewayâ€™s readability and contemporary appearance provide a nice contrast to Arapey, ensuring that the content is easy to read and visually appealing.

### Application

The consistent use of these two fonts helps to create a cohesive and elegant look throughout the website. Here is how they are applied:

- **Headings (Arapey)**: All major headings, including section titles use the Arapey font. This helps to create a hierarchy and guide the userâ€™s attention to important information.
- **Body Text (Raleway)**: All body text, including descriptions and general content, uses the Raleway font. This ensures that the text is clear and easy to read, contributing to a pleasant user experience.

By carefully selecting and pairing these fonts, the website achieves a harmonious visual experience that enhances readability while maintaining an elegant and professional appearance. This thoughtful typography choice reflects the overall aesthetic of the Art with Amanda brand, balancing artistic elegance with modern design principles.
