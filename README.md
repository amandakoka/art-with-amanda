# Art with Amanda 

Art with Amanda is a full-stack e-commerce website that I developed as my final milestone project for the Level 5 Diploma in Web Development with Code Institute. As an artist, I built this platform using Django, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase and sell my original artworks and prints. With Stripe integration for secure payments, the website provides a user-friendly interface where visitors can explore a diverse collection of my artwork, view detailed descriptions, and make purchases seamlessly. This project not only highlights my artistic endeavors but also demonstrates my proficiency in web development, combining my passion for art with modern technologies to create an engaging online gallery experience.

## Database schema 

## Wireframes
In the initial stages of designing Art with Amanda, I created rough sketches to visualize the layout and structure of the website. These sketches served as a blueprint for the final wireframes and helped shape the overall user experience. Below are the images of these sketches:

### Final Wireframes

After refining my initial sketches, I created detailed wireframes using Figma, a versatile and powerful design tool known for its collaborative features and ease of use. Figma allowed me to add images and create precise, polished representations of the website's layout. Below are the finalized wireframes:

#### Home Page

For the home page, I developed two different options and sought feedback from the Instagram community, as well as from family and friends, to determine which layout they preferred. The majority favored the first layout, so I decided to proceed with this design.

#### Account/Login/Sign Up Page

The account, login, and sign up pages were designed to streamline the user authentication process, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly experience. These wireframes include the following features:

- **Account Page**: Allows users to view and update their personal information, manage their password, and view their order history.
- **Login Page**: Provides a simple and secure interface for users to enter their credentials and access their accounts. It includes options for forgotten passwords and social media logins.
- **Sign Up Page**: Offers a straightforward registration form for new users, with fields for necessary personal information and security features to protect user data.

#### Shopping Bag Page

The shopping bag page wireframes were designed to provide users with a clear overview of their selected items, allowing for easy modifications to quantities and facilitating a straightforward checkout process. Key features include:

- **Item List**: Displays all selected items with thumbnails, names, prices, and quantity selectors.
- **Total Price**: Shows a summary of the total cost.

### Next Steps

With the wireframes finalized, I used them as a blueprint during the development phase to ensure the website aligns with the chosen layout and effectively meets user needs.


## Colour Scheme

In developing the Art with Amanda website, I prioritized a modern and simplistic design to ensure that my artwork remains the focal point. Based on user feedback, I selected a colour palette consisting of different shades of white and black. This neutral colour scheme helps to create a clean, elegant, and professional look that doesn't distract from the art photos.

<summary>Colour Palette</summary>
<br>
<img src="documentation/colourpalette.png">
</details>

The following is an overview of how the colour scheme is applied across different sections of the website:

- **Backgrounds**: The primary background colour is white, providing a bright and clean canvas for the artwork.
- **Text**: The main text colour is black, and white on dark backgrounds, ensuring high readability and contrast.
- **Borders and Dividers**: A light grey is used for subtle borders and dividers, adding structure to the layout without drawing attention away from the artwork.
- **Buttons and Links**: Buttons and interactive elements are styled in a black shade to stand out and be easily identifiable.

### User Feedback Integration

The decision to use a simple and neutral colour scheme was directly influenced by user feedback. Through preliminary discussions and Instagram polls, users expressed a preference for a minimalist design that highlights the artwork rather than the website itself. By adopting this feedback, the final colour scheme enhances the user experience and ensures that the artwork remains the central focus of the site.

By maintaining a consistent and simplistic colour scheme, the website provides a cohesive and enjoyable user experience that directs attention to the artwork while ensuring readability and ease of navigation.

## Typography

The typography for the Art with Amanda website is inspired by my logo, which features the Arapey font. To complement Arapey, I researched fonts that pair well with it and discovered Raleway. This combination was recommended by a resource on the best free Google Fonts, which you can find [here](https://daveyandkrista.com/best-free-google-fonts/#:~:text=Arapey%20would%20look%20great%20in,serif%20like%20Questrial%20or%20Raleway.).

### Font Choices

- **Arapey**: This elegant serif font is used for the headings. Its classic and sophisticated style adds a touch of refinement to the website, making it ideal for drawing attention to key areas like titles and section headers.
- **Raleway**: This clean and modern sans-serif font is used for body text. Ralewayâ€™s readability and contemporary appearance provide a nice contrast to Arapey, ensuring that the content is easy to read and visually appealing.

### Application

The consistent use of these two fonts helps to create a cohesive and elegant look throughout the website. Here is how they are applied:

- **Headings (Arapey)**: All major headings, including section titles use the Arapey font. This helps to create a hierarchy and guide the userâ€™s attention to important information.
- **Body Text (Raleway)**: All body text, including descriptions and general content, uses the Raleway font. This ensures that the text is clear and easy to read, contributing to a pleasant user experience.

By carefully selecting and pairing these fonts, the website achieves a harmonious visual experience that enhances readability while maintaining an elegant and professional appearance. This thoughtful typography choice reflects the overall aesthetic of the Art with Amanda brand, balancing artistic elegance with modern design principles.

## Imagery

The imagery for the Art with Amanda website plays a crucial role in showcasing the artwork in its best light. All photographs of my art are captured using an iPhone 12, which is the primary camera I have available. I aim to capture the artworks as close to their real appearance as possible, with minimal editing to ensure authenticity and preserve the artwork's natural beauty.

### Photography Process

1. **Capture**: Using the iPhone 12, I carefully photograph each artwork to ensure that the colours are accurate and the details are captured as they appear in real life.
   
2. **Minimal Editing**: After capturing the photos, I may do some simple edits to enhance the photograph and ensure it accurately represents the artwork's beauty. This may include adjusting brightness, contrast, and colour saturation to match the artwork's true appearance.

### Importance of Authentic Imagery

Authentic and high-quality imagery is crucial for an online art gallery as it allows potential buyers to see the artwork in detail and make informed decisions about their purchases. By using the iPhone 12 as my primary camera and minimizing editing, I ensure that each piece is represented authentically, creating a compelling visual experience for visitors to the website.

### Sample Photographs

Here are some examples of the artwork photographs taken with the iPhone 12 for the Art with Amanda website:

- [Photo 1](documentation/Imagery/jake_drawing.jpg)
- [Photo 2](documentation/Imagery/IMG_3255.jpg)
- [Photo 3](documentation/Imagery/zoOQO.jpeg)

These photographs demonstrate the clarity, detail, and colours captured with the iPhone 12, providing potential buyers with a true-to-life view of the artwork available for purchase.

## Mockup
For the Art with Amanda website, I created mockups to visualize the layout and design before development. These mockups were created using Wix, allowing me to experiment with different designs and user interfaces. Mockups help in understanding the overall structure of the website and provide a preview of how the final product will look and feel.

### Mockup Tool Used

I used **Wix** to create the mockups for Art with Amanda. Wix's drag-and-drop interface enabled me to design and customize various elements of the website easily.

### Screens Mocked Up

I created mockups for six key screens to explore different aspects of the website:

1. **Home Page**: This includes the main landing area, about the artist, and navigation.

2. **Artwork Listing Page**: A page showcasing all artworks with filtering and sorting options.

3. **Artwork Detail Page**: Detailed view of a single artwork with description, price, and options to purchase.

5. **Contact Page**: Form for visitors to reach out to Amanda for inquiries, commissions, or collaborations.

6. **Shopping Cart and Checkout**: Layout for viewing items in the cart, adjusting quantities, and completing the purchase through Stripe integration.

### Benefits of Mockups

- **Visualization**: Mockups provide a visual representation of the website's structure and layout.
- **Feedback**: They help gather feedback from stakeholders and potential users before development.
- **Planning**: Mockups aid in planning the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design.

### Example Mockup

Below is an example of the mockup for the Home Page created using Wix:

- [Home Page Mockup](documentation/Screenshot%202024-06-17%20at%2019.39.39.png)

### Next Steps

With the mockups finalized, I used them as a reference during the development phase to ensure the website aligns with the original vision and meets user needs effectively.

## Rationale for Development

The development of Art with Amanda was driven by several key factors:

1. **Market Demand**: There is a growing demand for unique, accessible, and online artwork purchasing options. This website aims to meet this demand by providing a platform for art enthusiasts to discover and purchase original artworks and prints.

2. **Personal Brand Growth**: As an artist, creating an online presence is crucial for expanding reach and establishing a brand. This website serves as a central hub for showcasing my work and interacting with potential buyers.

3. **User-Centric Design**: By prioritizing user feedback and involvement, the website development process ensures that the end product is aligned with user needs and preferences, enhancing the overall user experience.

4. **Technology Integration**: Leveraging modern web development technologies, such as Django for the backend and Stripe for secure payments, ensures a robust, scalable, and secure platform.

5. **Educational Milestone**: This project represents a significant milestone in my web development education, demonstrating the practical application of skills learned during my Level 5 Diploma in Web Development with Code Institute.
